# The Noble Quran

Fork of the Raycast Extension [The Noble Quran](https://www.raycast.com/BalliAsghar/the-noble-quran) by Balli Asghar, Jazahu Allahu Khairan.

This was forked via the Raycast `Fork Extension` feature to add some additional functionality that I found useful.

Enhancements:

1. Added ability to display and copy Arabic text, or both Arabic text and translation to clipboard. Previously only translation could be.
2. Added ability to quick lookup an ayah by specifying chapter and verse number (e.g. `2:255` or `2/255`).
   1. This makes use of the existing Surah cache to avoid re-fetching data from the API where possible.
3. Removed the, imo, redundant "Translation:" label before the translation text.

If Balli Asghar would like to merge these changes back into the original extension, I would be happy to facilitate that.
